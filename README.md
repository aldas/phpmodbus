# phpmodbus

Implementation of the basic functionality of the Modbus TCP and UDP based protocol using PHP. 

**NOTE: This is a fork to fix & update the library code (and code alone).**

##What's new

* This fork adds a namespace and fixes issues encountered when porting to PHP 7
* Fixes/replaces old MS Windows specific tests

## Implemented features

 * Modbus master
 * FC1 - Read coils 
 * FC2 - Read input discretes
 * FC3 - Read holding registers 
 * FC4 - Read holding input registers 
 * FC5 - Write single coil 
 * FC6 - Write single register
 * FC15 - Write multiple coils
 * FC16 - Write multiple registers
 * FC23 - Read/Write multiple registers


## Requirements

 * The PHP extension php_sockets.dll should be enabled (server php.ini file)
 * PHP 5.4 (5.6 for tests)

 
## Example

```php
use PHPModbus/ModbusMaster; 
use PHPModbus/PhpType; 

// Modbus master UDP
$modbus = new ModbusMaster("192.168.1.1", "UDP"); 
// Read multiple registers
try {
    $recData = $modbus->readMultipleRegisters(0, 12288, 5); 
} catch (Exception $e) {
    // Print error information if any
    echo $modbus;
    echo $e;
    exit;
}
// Print data in string format
echo PhpType::bytes2string($recData); 
```

Use the `setTimeout($seconds)` and `setSocketTimeout($read_timeout_sec, $write_timeout_sec)` methods to adjust wait times.

Most of the code is (to some extent) commented and documented with PhpDoc. You should get useful tooltips in your IDE.

## Tests

To run the test suite, you need install the dependencies via composer, then
run PHPUnit. 

NB: PHP 5.6+ is required for tests

    composer install
    composer test # or under Windows vendor\bin\phunit.bat
    
To report test coverage (created inside ./report/html):

    composer test-coverage
